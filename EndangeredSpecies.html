	<h2>What Is A Blue Eyed Lemur?</h2> 
	
<p>A blue eyed lemur is a primate and a mammal. The adult usually weighs about five pounds
and they are sexually dichromatic, meaning that the color of their fur differs between the gender.
Males are completely black, while females vary from reddish-brown to gray. They can be found in
the Sambirano region in northwest Madagascar, while Pure populations are found south of 
the Andranomalaza River near Moromandia and east to the Sandrakota River near Befotaka.</p> 

	<h3>What Does A Blue Eyed Lemur Eat?</h3>
<p>Blue eyed lemurs tend to eat ripe fruit, leaves, flowers and occasionally insects. They
Have been seen to eat primarily fruit during the rainy season when it is readily abundant. 
During the dry season when fruit becomes scarce, lemurs turn to leaves, flowers, nectar and seeds.
But, there are some exceptions. In bad habitats, they have been seen to be feeding on soil.
When captured, they will usually catch and eat a variety of birds like cardinals, brown 
thrashers, and eastern peewees.</p>

	<h4>What Is The Breeding Like For Blue Eyed Lemurs?</h4>
<p>Blue-eyed black lemurs, like all diurnal lemurs, are seasonal breeders. 
In Madagascar, the breeding season ranges from April to June. In the northern hemisphere,
most breeding occurs in November and December with births in March and April. During breeding 
season, both males and females experience physiological changes. The males become more 
aggressive towards and less tolerant of their fellow males. When the mother has given
birth, after the gestation period of about 126 days, she might immediately become very 
aggressive to other members of their group, threatening them and lunging at them if they 
come too close to her one or two offsprings. After a few days or a week of guarding the infants, 
Juveniles are typically granted first access to the newborns, followed by the father, and 
later the other adult females in the group.</p>

	<h5>Why Are Blue Eyed Lemurs Endangered And What Is Happening To Stop Their Extinction?</h5> <!-- I have to have h1, h2, h3, h4, and h5 in case I want to change each one in the css -->
<p>Blue-eyed lemurs are severely threatened by hunting, trapping and forest destruction,
especially from slash and burn agriculture. Blue-eyed lemurs are consistently placed in 
the top ten of the most endangered varieties of lemurs, and it is thought that there are 
probably less than 1,000 individuals of this species left in the wild. There is an SSP 
(Species Survival Plan) in place for this lemur and institutions holding this species are 
working together cooperatively to maintain genetic diversity. To help them, you can adopt 
one, visit the Duke Lemur Center because the tour money goes towards the Lemurs, send them 
presents like raw materials to the DLC, and look in your area for any DLC run conservations</p>
